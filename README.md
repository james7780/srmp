Star Raiders Multiplayer, web app using node.js

This is a multiplayer remake of Atari 8-bit classic "Star Raiders".

It is an attempt to simply replicate the original game with multiplayer gameplay.
At this point no other enhancements are planned.

Why?
  - SR is a much loved and fondly remembered game, just screaming for a remake.
  - I want to learn MP game programming techniques "from the ground up".
  - I think it would be cool to play SR with friends.

The server is written in node.js:
  - Manages the game world
  - Communicates with clients (players)

Vision:
~~~~~~

- Remake of Star Raiders for modern systems.
- Preserve gameplay (fun)
- Multiplayer
- Easier controls

Alternate Names:
- "Star Raiders Online"
- "Star Raiders Universe"


Technical:

Platforms? (PC/PSP/Vita/Android/iOS?)
C++ or C#?
Multiplayer (networking) engine? (node.js?)
OpenGL gfx (WebGL?)



Multiplayer:

- Server manages game world
- Server gets input from clients
- Server broadcasts game world deltas to clients
	- 10 per sec?
	- Only relevant info sent to each client
- Client must interpolate object positions
	- display is 30 to 60 fps
	- object position only updated max 10fps from server
	- interp only neccessary for objects visible to the player
- Mplayer chat/text
- Hyperwarp to other player area
- Refuel other player (fuel transfer)
- Game modes
	- Single player
	- Coop vs Zylons (up to 8 players?)
		- If player joins, then hyperspace jump is detected by Zylons and they launch a new fleet
	- Player vs player? (Zylon player vs Atarian player?)
	- Starbase vs Basestar
		- 1st team to destroy the other team's starbase wins

Design/gameplay inspiration:
- Star Raiders (8-bit)
- Starhawk (1977)
- Star Fire (1979)
- Star Trek
- Solaris
- Starmaster (Activision)
- Star Luster (!) http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Star_Luster

SCREENS:
1. Title
2. Multiplayer
	- Start / Join game / Global Ranking
3. Fore/Aft view
4. Galactic chart
5. Long range scan
6. Docking
7. Score/Ranking (same as global ranking)


Objects:

Starbase
	- Does not move
	- Used for resupply
	- Heavily shielded (1000 health)

Zylon fighter
	- Fast moving
	- No shield

Zylon cruiser
	- Slower moving 
	- Lightly shielded
	- Patrol pattern (around basestar)
	- Does not attack unless provoked

Zylon Basestar
	- Slower moving
	- Heavily shielded (and shield regenerates slowly)
	- Can only be attacked from close range
	- Slow to react (target starbase only calculated every 30 seconds)
	- ALL basestars move toward the SAME starbase

Zylon fleets (collection of basestar + cruisers + fighter) will surround the nearest Starbase
and eventually destroy it. They will only attempt to surround 1 starbase at a time. (For multiplayer with 4 players or more, we could change this rule, maybe to n / 2 starbases).

Meteor
	- Fast moving
	- Can damage your ship (even with shields up)
	- Destroy your ship if shields down


Tables:
	Ship damage (good/damaged/destroyed)
		- Guns damaged (can't fire)
		- Engines damaged (slower)
		- Attack computer damage (no target range, no target lock)
		- Shield damage (flicker on and off)
		- Long-range scan damaged (mirror image, or flickery)
		- Sub-space radio (no status messages?)


Other ideas:
1. "Success meter" - shows your probability of winning (based on how many basestars are left and how close they are to their targets)
2. Dynamic rating - your rating is calculated "real time" as displayed as you play
3. Prevent boring/frustrating bits of dogfighting (eg: circling, bad collision detection)
	- Attack patterns of enemies must be (mostly) predictable
	- Avoid having enemies that are (too quick)
        - Homing bullets/missiles
	- Enemies can become damaged, either disabling/restricting their movement, or disabling their guns
	- Damaged enemies head for the basestar for repair
